# Simple fleshcard app

### What is this?

- This is a simple flash card app

### Why was it made?

- During my Czech lessons, I often jot down new words and their meanings in a text editor. I realized that organizing them within an app would be more efficient than keeping them in a single large text file (after all, a JSON file serves the same purpose).
- While my primary motivation for creating this was language learning, it could be valuable for various memorization tasks as well.
- Work is almost fully JS/TS so wanted to do something in python for fun

### Features

- Display flashcards with front and back text.
- Navigate between flashcards using next and previous buttons.
- Show image on the back of the flashcard if available.
- Show a placeholder image if no image is available.
- Allow users to reveal the back of the flashcard by clicking a "Show" button.
- Enable keyboard shortcuts for navigation and revealing the back of the flashcard
  - W - for Show
  - A - for Previous Card
  - D - for Next Card
- Display the current card number out of the total number of cards.
